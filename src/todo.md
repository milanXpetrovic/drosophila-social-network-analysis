**MAIN**

## New features

- [ ] `main` - Add time threshold between two interactions
- [ ] `feature` random networks from data
- [ ] `feature` add directed weighted ER networks genration
- [ ] `feature` - measures_correlation (result_table)
- [ ] `feature` - subgraphs of size 4, 5, 6, ...

- [ ] `analysis` - distance traveled
- [ ] `analysis` - Z-scores
- [ ] `analysis` - Triadic closure
- [ ] `analysis` - histogram of times between interaction
- [ ] `analysis` - plot poing with ave value and se


- [ ] `feature` - create data converter for matlab SL script
- create discretization spatial method
- social distance and angle plot script
- fix nan/inf values in data

### Done

- [x] `main` - Enable multiple types of treatments to process 
- [x] `main` - Create directed graphs
- [x] `main` - Normalization from px to mm convert 

- [x] `random_networks` -  1_3_1_create_random_networks

- [x] `dynamics` - 1_2_dynamics_of_network

- [x] `analysis` - 4_0_statistic_tests
- [x] `analysis` - 3_3_network_measure_distribution_plot
- [x] `analysis` - 3_1_distance_traveled_plots
- [x] `analysis` - count_of_interactions_in_time

**ML**
- [ ] `main` - Find outlayers in movement
