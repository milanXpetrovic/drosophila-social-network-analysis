**Tags:** `main`, `random_networks`, `dynamics`, `temporal`, `analysis`


**MAIN**

## New features

- [ ] `main` - Add time threshold between two interactions
- [ ] `analysis` - Triadic closure
- [ ] `analysis` - measures_correlation (result_table)

- [ ] `analysis` - add analysis like Levine lab
    - Interaction duration (sec), Movement (mm/s), Interaction Rate (interactions/min), Assortativity (Z-scores), Clustering Coefficient (Z-scores), Global Efficiency (Z-scores), Betweenness Centrality (Z-scores), interaction reciprocity




### Done

- [x] `main` - Enable multiple types of treatments to process 
- [x] `main` - Create directed graphs
- [x] `main` - Normalization from px to mm convert 

- [x] `random_networks` -  1_3_1_create_random_networks

- [x] `dynamics` - 1_2_dynamics_of_network

- [x] `analysis` - 4_0_statistic_tests
- [x] `analysis` - 3_3_network_measure_distribution_plot
- [x] `analysis` - 3_1_distance_traveled_plots
- [x] `analysis` - count_of_interactions_in_time

**ML**
- [ ] `main` - Find outlayers in movement
