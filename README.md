[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD--3%20Clause-green)](https://github.com/milanXpetrovic/my_module/blob/main/LICENSE.md)


The purpose of this Python pipeline is to create a toolkit for analysing tracking data.

The project is open-source and aims to create research tools. If you are interested in development, feel free to contact us.

Currently, the module is being tested on data obtained by monitoring Dosophila melanogaster populations and social interaction networks are being created from track data.

## Pipeline functionalities
- Functions for loading, validating, and preprocessing data.
- Functions for creating trajectory descriptors and ML features.
- Population analysis, distances between elements from the trajectory
- Complex network construction
- Complex network analysis

## How to use?

Run `__main__.py` from `./src` all results will be saved to `./data/results`
